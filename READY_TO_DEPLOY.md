## 🎯 MARKETING STRATEGY

### Goal
**Get downloads** — NOT sales, NOT conversions to Pro

### Messaging
- "Built by divers who were frustrated with existing tools"
- "Skuba brings features you didn't know you needed"
- Focus on **unique value**, not price

### Target Audience
1. Professional technical divers
2. Diving publications (DeeperBlue, ScubaBoard)
3. Frustrated Multi-deco/Baltic users
4. Instructors and dive shops

### vs Multi-deco
```

✅ Skuba: QR code sharing, unified gas model
```

### vs Baltic Deco
```
❌ Baltic: No contingency scenarios, manual recalc
✅ Skuba: Instant what-if scenarios (5 mins, 5m, lost gas)
```

### vs Both
```
❌ Competitors: Desktop-focused, complex UI
✅ Skuba: Mobile-first, boat-ready, wet-thumb friendly
```
